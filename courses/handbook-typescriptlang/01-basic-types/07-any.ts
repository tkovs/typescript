// Any

// We may need to describe the type of variables that we do not know when we
// are writing an application. These values may come from dynamic content, e.g.
// from the user or a 3rd party library. In these cases, we want to opt-out of
// type-checking and let the values pass through compile-time checks. To do so,
// we label these with the any type:
let notSure: any = 4;
notSure = "maybe a string instead";
notSure = false;

// The any type is a powerful way to work with existing JavaScript, allowing
// you to gradually opt-in and opt-out of type-checking during compilation.
// You might expect Object to play a similar role, as it does in other
// languages. But variables of type Object only allow you to assign any value to
// them - you canâ€™t call arbitrary methods on them, even ones that actually
// exist:
notSure = 4;
notSure.ifItExists(); // okay, ifItExists might exist at runtime
notSure.toFixed(); // okay, toFixed exists (but the compiler doesn't check)

let prettySure: Object = 4;
prettySure.toFixed(); // Error: Property 'toFixed' doesn't exist on type 'Object'

// The any type is also handy if you know some part of the type, but perhaps not
// all of it. For example, you may have an array but the array has a mix of
// different types:
let list: any[] = [1, true, "free"];
list[1] = 100;
