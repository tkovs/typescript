// A note about Let

// You may’ve noticed that so far, we’ve been using the let keyword instead of
// JavaScript’s var keyword which you might be more familiar with. The let
// keyword is actually a newer JavaScript construct that TypeScript makes
// available. We’ll discuss the details later, but many common problems in
// JavaScript are alleviated by using let, so you should use it instead of var
// whenever possible.
