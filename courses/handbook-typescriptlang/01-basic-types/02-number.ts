// Number

// As in JavaScript, all numbers in TypeScript are floating point values. These
// floating point numbers get the type number. In addition to hexadecimal and
// decimal literals, TypeScript also supports binary and octal literals
// introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
let decimal: number = 6;
let hex: number = 0xf00d;
let binary: number = 0b1010;
let octal: number = 0o744;
