// Enum

// A helpful addition to the standard set of datatypes from JavaScript is the
// enum. As in languages like C#, an enum is a way of giving more friendly
// names to sets of numeric values.
enum Color {Red, Green, Blue};
let c: Color = Color.Green;

// By default, enums begin numbering their members starting at 0. You can
// change this by manually setting the value of one of its members. For
// example, we can start the previous example at 1 instead of 0:
enum Color2 {Red = 1, Green, Blue};
let c2: Color2 = Color2.Green;

// Or, even manually set all the values in the enum:
enum Color3 {Red = 1, Green = 2, Blue = 4};
let c3: Color3 = Color3.Green;

// A handy feature of enums is that you can also go from a numeric value to
// the name of that value in the enum. For example, if we had the value 2 but
// werenâ€™t sure what that mapped to in the Color enum above, we could look up
// the corresponding name:
let colorName: string = Color[Color.Green];

console.log(colorName);
