// String

// Another fundamental part of creating programs in JavaScript for webpages and
// servers alike is working with textual data. As in other languages, we use
// the type string to refer to these textual datatypes. Just like JavaScript,
// TypeScript also uses double quotes (") or single quotes (') to surround
// string data.
let color: string = "blue";
color = 'red';

// You can also use template strings, which can span multiple lines and have embedded expressions. These strings are surrounded by the backtick/backquote (`) character, and embedded expressions are of the form ${ expr }.
let fullName: string = `Bob Bobbington`;
let age: number = 37;
let sentence: string = `Hello, my name is ${ fullName }.
I'll be ${ age + 1 } years old next month.`;

// This is equivalent to declaring sentence like so:
sentence = "Hello, my name is " + fullName + ".\n\n" +
    "I'll be " + (age + 1) + " years old next month.";
